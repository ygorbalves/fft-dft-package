## Details
DFT consists of converting a signal in the time domain to the frequency domain.
It is a mathematical tool of great applicability in the solution of digital image processing problems, since the signal in the frequency domain has its processing facilitated. Added to this, there is applicability in failure analysis, quality control and condition monitoring of machines or systems.
The FFT is an optimized algorithm for implementing the DFT.
From an Input file in 'txt' format with the first column being the real component and the second column the imaginary component, you should get the output file after the calculations performed.
